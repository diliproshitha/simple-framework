# Simple Framework
### A simple framework to show that, there is no magic in spring.

I am writing a series of articles in medium, to explain the spring internals. 
Most people do not understand what is happening behind the Spring framework. 
So in this article series I am going to develop a simple framework step by step, 
explaining, major functionalities in Spring.

This repository is divided into sections, to match with each article like part1, part2.. likewise.
